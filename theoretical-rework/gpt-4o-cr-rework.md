# GPT-4o Theoretical Rework

_LLM prompted to “rework the [political priest] analysis in three paragraphs from a Critical Realist perspective”_

From a critical realist perspective, Steven’s political identity is not merely a discursive performance but a reflection of underlying structures and mechanisms—religious, institutional, and ideological—that shape and constrain his agentive positioning. His emphatic response “NO” (line 15) to the bishop’s question about keeping politics out of the pulpit is not just a rhetorical move but an index of his deeper ethical and ontological commitments. For a critical realist, identity is emergent from the interplay between structure and agency (Archer, 2000); here, Steven’s narrative reveals a process of reflexive deliberation in which he reconciles the normative expectations of the Church with his political convictions. The church’s institutional role acts as a conditioning—but not determining—structure, to which Steven responds through evaluative judgement and moral reasoning.

His identity talk, particularly the statement that “faith and politics are actually completely intertwined” (line 22), can be seen as a claim about the stratified nature of social reality. Steven rejects the secular liberal model of separating religion from political life, asserting instead a deeper ontological linkage between theological belief and socio-political praxis. This articulation reflects a commitment to a moral realism, where values are not arbitrary or relativistic but grounded in a conception of the good, shaped by both religious tradition and political ideology. His disavowal of party-political endorsements from the pulpit (line 28) reflects a negotiated position within a complex moral ecology: one that recognises institutional constraints while insisting on the legitimacy of prophetic, value-driven political speech.

Finally, the humorous distancing from Labour in lines 34–35 illustrates what Margaret Archer (2003) would call “contextual discontinuity”—the tensions that emerge when multiple roles (priest, citizen, party member) require negotiation. Steven’s narrative is not simply a reflection of situational performance, but evidence of an internal conversation—a deliberative evaluative process—by which he arrives at a stable but dynamic sense of self. His use of narrative, stance, and alignment is not just discursive; it indexes the deeper mechanisms by which social identities are shaped in relation to both institutional norms and personal ethical commitments. The interaction thus reveals identity as a causally efficacious phenomenon, situated within but not reducible to immediate discursive context.
